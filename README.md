# Put Deep Learning to work: Accelerate Deep Learning through AWS EC2 and ML Services   
 

----------


##Abstract 
Deploying deep learning (DL) projects are becoming increasingly more pervasive at enterprises and startups alike. At Amazon, Machine Learning University (MLU)-trained engineers are taking DL to every aspect of Amazonâ€™s businesses, beyond just Amazon Go, Alexa, and Robotics. In this hands-on tutorial, Wenming Ye (AWS) and Rachel Hu (AWS) offer a practical next step in DL learning with instructions, and hands-on labs using the latest Nvidia GPUs and AWS Inferentia. You will explore the current trends powering AI/DL adoption, powerful new GPU/AWS Inferentia accelerator instances, distributed training and inference optimization in neural networks.
